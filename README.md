# Generating-a-monet-style-images-using-GAN

Technologies used: Neural networks(GAN), Keras, TensorFlow

• Created Monet style images for photo images using neural networks (GAN-Generative Adversarial Networks) with  TensorFlow and Keras to trick classifiers into believing that a true Monet is created.
• This was Kaggle competition where we ranked 19 on public score standings
